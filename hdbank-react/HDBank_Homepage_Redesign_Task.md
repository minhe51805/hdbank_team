# Analysis (Populated by RESEARCH mode)

## Current Homepage Structure Analysis
Based on examination of `src/pages/HomePage.tsx` and `src/pages/HomePage.css`:

### Current Components:
1. **HeroBanner** - Basic hero section with integrated loan calculator
2. **Services Section** - "Dịch vụ nổi bật" with Services component
3. **Products Section** - Two sections for personal and corporate banking products
4. **News Section** - Latest news and promotions in two columns
5. **Download App Section** - Mobile app promotion with gradient background
6. **Contact Section** - Contact information with icons

### Key Differences from Target Design:
1. **Missing Promotion Banner** - The red banner "HDBank BEMAX - Tài khoản tối đa lợi ích" is not present
2. **Hero Section Content** - Current hero doesn't match the "CHO VAY MUA NHÀ" (Home Loan) theme
3. **Layout Structure** - Missing the specific three-column layout with:
   - Left sidebar menu (Mở tài khoản, Vay trực tuyến, Mở thẻ ngay)
   - Center main content (loan promotion)
   - Right sidebar calculator (Ước tính khoản vay)
4. **Visual Design** - Background, colors, and typography don't match target
5. **Content Focus** - Current content is general banking, target focuses on home loans

### Technical Requirements:
- Need to create/modify HeroBanner component
- Need to add promotion banner component
- Need to add sidebar navigation menu
- Need to create loan calculator component
- Need to update styling to match target design
- May need to update header if it doesn't match target

### File Dependencies Identified:
- `src/components/sections/HeroBanner.tsx` (needs major redesign)
- `src/components/sections/HeroBanner.css` (needs major styling updates)
- `src/pages/HomePage.tsx` (may need structure changes)
- `src/components/layout/Header.tsx` (may need updates)

### Constraints:
- Must maintain React/TypeScript structure
- Must be responsive design
- Must integrate with existing app architecture
- Must preserve existing functionality while updating design
- **IMPORTANT: Keep existing Header/top navigation bar completely unchanged**
- Only modify main content area of homepage

# Proposed Solution (Populated by INNOVATE mode)

## Recommended Approach: Modular Component Enhancement

After analyzing multiple approaches, the optimal solution is to use a **Modular Component Enhancement** strategy that preserves existing functionality while implementing the target design accurately.

### Component Architecture Design:

1. **PromotionBanner Component** (New)
   - Reusable banner component for promotional content
   - Red gradient background matching HDBank branding
   - Configurable text content for future promotions
   - Responsive design with mobile optimization

2. **HeroBanner Redesign** (Major Modification)
   - Three-column layout using CSS Grid/Flexbox
   - Left: Sidebar navigation menu
   - Center: Main promotional content (CHO VAY MUA NHÀ theme)
   - Right: Loan calculator form
   - Background image integration
   - Typography and styling to match target design

3. **LoanSidebarMenu Component** (New)
   - Vertical navigation menu with banking service options
   - Interactive hover effects
   - Icon integration
   - Mobile-responsive collapsible design

4. **LoanCalculator Component** (New) 
   - Interactive loan calculation form
   - Real-time calculation updates
   - Input validation and formatting
   - Results display with proper Vietnamese formatting

### Technical Strategy:
- **Layout**: CSS Grid for main structure, Flexbox for component internals
- **Styling**: CSS modules for component isolation
- **State Management**: Local component state for calculator, props for configuration
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with breakpoint-specific layouts
- **TypeScript**: Strong typing for all props and state interfaces

### Benefits of This Approach:
- Maintains existing app functionality and routing
- Modular components can be reused across the application
- Easy to test and debug individual components
- Scalable architecture for future enhancements  
- Preserves React best practices and patterns
